### Theory

The degree of static indeterminacy of a structure is a measure of how many unknown internal forces and reactions exist within the structure, beyond those that can be determined through the application of the equations of static equilibrium. In other words, it measures the number of additional equations that must be solved to fully determine the internal forces and reactions within the structure.

There are various conditions used to determine the static indeterminacy of various type of structures:

R = C + 3 (For Beams)    B + R = 2J (For Truss)      3B + R = 3J + C (For Rigid Frames)

Where d is the degree of static indeterminacy, j is the number of joints or points of connection within the structure, and r is the number of reaction components (i.e., vertical, horizontal, and moment) at each support.

A statically determinate structure has zero degree of static indeterminacy, meaning that all internal forces and reactions can be determined solely through the application of static equilibrium equations. A statically indeterminate structure, on the other hand, has a non-zero degree of static indeterminacy and requires additional equations beyond the equations of static equilibrium to fully determine internal forces and reactions.

To determine the additional equations needed to solve for internal forces and reactions in a statically indeterminate structure, various methods can be used, such as the force method, displacement method, and flexibility method. These methods involve the use of compatibility equations, which describe the relationship between deformations and rotations at different points within the structure, and equilibrium equations, which describe the balance of forces and moments within the structure.

In summary, the degree of static indeterminacy is a crucial factor in determining the internal forces and reactions within a structure, and its calculation is an important step in the analysis of statically indeterminate structures.
