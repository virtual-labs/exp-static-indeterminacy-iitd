### Theory

Kinematic indeterminacy refers to the number of independent displacements in a structure in terms of which all other displacements can be expressed. The degree of kinematic indeterminacy of a structure depends on its type (beam, frame, truss etc.) and the number type of supports. The degree of kinematic indeterminacy (DKI) is also called as the degree of freedom. Determination of DKI is the first step in structural analysis using displacement method such as slope deflection method, moment distribution method and the matrix/direct stiffness method.

 In contrast to static indeterminacy, which arises from an excess of unknown internal forces or moments, kinematic indeterminacy arises from unknown independent displacements (translations & rotations). The kinematic indeterminacy increases by introduction of members. It can be reduced by the addition constraints or boundary conditions that restrict the possible deformations of the structure. For example, fixing one end of a beam compared to roller support can reduce the DOF of the structure.

The presence of internal hinges or deformable connections leads to increase in kinematic indeterminacy, as these elements introduce additional degrees of freedom that cannot be determined from the external loads and geometry alone. Kinematic indeterminacy can have practical implications for the design and analysis of structures, as it can affect the distribution of internal forces and stresses and the overall stability of the structure. Overall, the degree of kinematic indeterminacy is an important factor to consider when designing structures and analyzing their behavior under load.
